# Curved-Lines
some Curved Line previews with P5.JS such as curve() and bezier()...  
just start index.html and start drawing with your mouse.  
and different versions of it can be found in 'AllCurveExamples.txt'  
you can replace any of versions with the codes in 'sketch.js'  
or even Create your own and show it to me... ☺☻
always have fun when codding
